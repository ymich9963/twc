- Values of k used in calculating the cs_area:

    k = 0.0240000 (Internal layers)
k = 0.0480000 (External layers)

    - Use trace length with '-l' to get voltage, resistance and power calculations.

    - Calculations limitations are listed below, with inputs outside these limitations being more error prone,
    + Currents up to 35 A external and 17.5 A internal. 
    + Temperature rises from 10 C to 100 C.
    + Trace widths between 0 and 10.16mm.
    + Copper weights between 0.5 and 3 oz/ft^2.
    + No vias along the length of the trace.

    - Constants and method used were derived from http://circuitcalculator.com/wordpress/2006/03/12/pcb-via-calculator/.

    - TWC used the IPC2152 standard, Method A.

    Design assistance by the TWC tool is provided with no liability whatsover. For final decisions on electronics designs, please consult an actual qualified person.
